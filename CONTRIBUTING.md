# Contribution

## Project Values and Team Norms
Our values include:
- Honesty. When we think something could be better, we should let the each other know.
- Empathy. Everyone is trying their best and we should respect that.
- Commitment. We should do our tasks to the best of our ability.
- Responsibility. When we have been assigned a task, we should own it. 
- Communication. When we need help, we should ask. When we are adding or completing something, we should let everyone know.

## Definition of Done
A task is considered "done" when it has been completed by those responsible to the best of their abilities and ALL teammates agree that
it does not need anything else added to it. 

## Git Workflow
- When we want to make a new addition to the software, we should do it to a separate branch of the software and then merge it.
- All team members should be notified when a branch has been made and when a new feature is being implemented.
- All team members should be notified when a change has been made to the main branch.
- All team members should be notified of any pending pull requests.

## Rules of Contribution
If you have any ideas, please run them by the group. If you would like to make a contribution to the main branch, please adhere to all the rules above. Thank you for reading!
