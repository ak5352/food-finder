# Food Finder

## Project Description
Food Finder is a web app that aims to make finding restaurants more efficient. Users can filter through restaurants using criteria
such as distance from current location, cuisine type, and price, compile a list of all restaurants that they have visited, and even 
explore new restaurants in the area tbrough a randomized restaurant selection feature. 

## Project History
The concept for Food Finder came about through a desire to just find a place to eat. People waste a lot of time trying to decide where
they want to get food and the entire affair can be painful and irritating. That's when we came in, 
a group of Computer Science students attempting to do what software developers do best: automate the process.
